      title: Privacy Policy
      text: |
        Data protection is of high priority for the Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB). As a general rule, the use of TIB’s services does not require the provision of any personal data. However, the processing of personal data may be required where a data subject wants to use special services via the TIB’s web pages. Where the processing of personal data is required and where there is no legal basis for such processing, we shall obtain the data subject’s consent.
        
        The processing of personal data, such as for example the data subject’s name, address, email address, or telephone number shall always be carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the state and institution-specific data protection rules and regulations applicable to the TIB. This privacy statement serves to inform the public about the nature, scope and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process, as well as of the rights data subjects are entitled to.
        
        The terms used in this privacy statement are to be understood within the meaning of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

        Any data subject may contact our data protection officer directly regarding any and all questions and suggestions regarding data protection at any time.
        
        ## Contact Possibility via the Web Pages
        
        The TIB’s web pages contain information and forms that enable quick electronic contacting via contact form or by email providing name and email address also for customers not registered with the TIB. The indication of name and email address is necessary to establish contact following clarification of the data subject’s concerns. The personal data transmitted by the data subject to the TIB via email or via a contact form are automatically stored internally and only for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject.
        
        ## Scope of the Processing of Personal Data
        In accordance with applicable laws, we process personal data to the minimal extent necessary for providing our services, improving functionality, and ensuring compliance with legal obligations.
        
        We process personal data based on the following legal grounds as defined in Art. 6 GDPR:
        * **Consent (Art. 6(1a))**: When you have explicitly consented to specific data processing activities.
        * **Contractual Necessity (Art. 6(1b))**: When processing is required for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual arrangements.
        * **Legal Obligations (Art. 6(1c))**: When processing is necessary to fulfill legal responsibilities.
        * **Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1f))**: When processing is necessary for our legitimate interests, such as ensuring the security of our digital infrastructure, provided this does not override your fundamental rights and freedoms.
        
        ## Routine Deletion and Blocking of Personal Data
        
        The TIB processes and stores the data subject’s personal data only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of such storage and in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and the country and institution-specific data protection regulations applicable to the TIB. Thereafter, the personal data will routinely be blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.
        
        ## Using the Website for Informational Purposes
        If you visit our website solely for informational purposes, you may do so without providing any personal data. However, for technical reasons, certain server log data is automatically transmitted by your browser and processed by us. This data may include:
        * IP address
        * date and time of access
        * browser type and version
        * operating system
        
        To ensure the website functions properly and maintain the security of our information technology systems, this data is temporarily stored in log files. The legal basis for this temporary storage is Art. 6(1e) of the GDPR.
        
        ## Integrated Third Party Services
        
        ### Understanding Our Third Party Processing and Your Privacy
        To ensure the proper functioning of our website, user engagement tracking, and content delivery, we work with external service providers for data processing tasks. These providers may collect and analyse user data, such as IP addresses, browser information, and access logs, in compliance with data protection regulations. For example, this data may be used to host the website, monitor user interactions, and gather statistics on page visits or content engagement. All third-party data processing is done transparently, and we implement contracts to ensure that data processing complies with GDPR requirements. The external data processing services are listed below with explanations/examples.
        
        Each of these tools helps us improve your experience on the website, but you always have control over your data. If you have any questions about these services or your privacy, please reach out to our data protection officer.
        
        ### Web Analytics via Matomo <!-- de.NBI version --->
        We use Matomo, a privacy-focused open-source web analytics software, to analyse the usage of our website and improve its content. This section explains how we collect and process anonymised usage statistics through Matomo, ensuring that your privacy is protected.
        
        #### What Data is Collected
        Matomo collects the following anonymised data:
        * anonymised IP address
        * pages accessed and their sequence
        * time spent on individual pages
        * browser type and version
        * operating system
        * country of origin
        * date and time of access
        * referring pages (where you accessed our website from)
        
        #### Anonymisation of the Data
        To protect your privacy, your IP address is immediately anonymised by Matomo, preventing it from being traced back to you. This is done by shortening the last two bytes of the IP address, ensuring complete anonymity of the collected data. For example, if your IP address is 192.168.100.123, it will be anonymised to 192.168.0.0, ensuring complete anonymity of the collected data.
        
        #### Intended Use of the Data
        The data collected through Matomo is used to analyse and measure the use of our website to improve its reach and effectiveness. This helps us optimise the website's content and report to the German Research Foundation (DFG), which funds our project. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, as we have a legitimate interest in improving our website and fulfilling reporting requirements.
        
        #### Storage and Deletion of Data
        The anonymised data is stored on the servers of the Center for Biotechnology (CeBiTec) at Bielefeld University as part of the de.NBI project. The data is not shared with third parties or combined with other datasets. It is retained only for as long as necessary for the purposes outlined above, and it is deleted once no longer required.
        
        <!-- section not applicable as use of cookies is deactivated for Matomo for PID4NFDI
        #### Matomo Cookies
        We use Matomo cookies to anonymously track how you use our website, helping us improve your experience. These cookies include:
        * The _\_pk\_id_ cookie, which stores an anonymous user ID for 13 months.
        * The _\_pk\_ref_ cookie, which records where you came from (the referrer URL) for 6 months.
        * The _\_pk\_ses_ cookie, a session cookie that lasts for 30 minutes and temporarily stores your visit data.
        
        These cookies are only used for web analytics on our site and are not shared with other websites. When you return to the website, the validity of these cookies is renewed. Once they expire, they are automatically deleted. For example, after 13 months, the _\_pk\_id_ cookie will no longer store your user ID and will be removed. Most importantly, we do not track you across other websites or domains; these cookies are used only on this site for the purposes mentioned above.
        --->
        
        #### Your Rights and Option to Object
        As we do not collect personal data while using Matomo, you do not need to exercise rights such as access, correction, or deletion of personal data. However, if you prefer to opt out of data collection, you can disable Matomo tracking by enabling the _Do Not Track_ feature in your browser settings, and no data is collected by the tool at all.

        ### GitHub
        
        #### Web Hosting via GitHub Pages
        Our website is provided through GitHub Pages to ensure the smooth operation of our website. It enables us to host our website directly from our GitHub Repository, which helps us manage and share the code of our website, allowing our development team to collaborate on updates and improvements.
        
        #### What It Does
        GitHub Pages allows our development team to maintain and deploy website updates quickly. It is based on a GitHub repository, which you can think of as a shared workspace where our team can make changes, suggest improvements, and instantly see the results. For example, when one developer fixes a bug, the entire team can review and verify the change in real time.
        
        #### How It Handles Data
        When visiting our website hosted with GitHub Pages, some information, such as your IP address, may be collected by GitHub. This is handled in accordance with GitHub’s privacy policy, [which you can review here](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement). Please note that GitHub, as a third-party service, may process data according to its privacy practices, which are separate from ours.
        
        ### jsDelivr
        
        #### What It Does
        jsDelivr is built into our website theme and provides some files for the technical operation in the background of our website. It provides commonly used code snippets directly to you for a smoothly functioning website. For example, think of jsDelivr as a library that ‘lends’ commonly used JavaScript code to your browser. When you visit a website, it borrows this code from the library and stores it on your computer, so you don’t need to download it again the next time you visit a site that uses the same code, unless a newer version of it is available.
        
        #### How It Handles Data
        When you visit our website, your browser connects to jsDelivr to retrieve the needed JavaScript code. During this, some data like your IP address and the time of your visit will be processed by jsDelivr. You can find out more about how they handle your data [in their privacy policy](https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy).
        
        ### Netlify
        
        #### What It Does
        Netlify is built into our website theme and provides some files for the technical operation in the background of our website. It provides commonly used code snippets directly to you for a smoothly functioning website. For example, think of Netlify as a library that ‘lends’ commonly used CSS code to your browser. When you visit a website, it borrows this code from the library and stores it on your computer, so you don’t need to download it again the next time you visit a site that uses the same code, unless a newer version of it is available.
        
        #### How It Handles Data
        When you visit our website, your browser connects to Netlify to retrieve the needed CSS code. During this, some data like your IP address and the time of your visit will be processed by Netlify. You can find out more about how they handle your data [in their privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).
        
        ## Your Rights under GDPR
        As a data subject, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants you specific rights regarding the processing of your personal data. These rights (Art. 15-21 GDPR) ensure transparency, control, and fairness. You may exercise them at any time, as outlined below:
        
        ### 1. Right of Access, Rectification, and Erasure
        You have the right to
        * be informed when your data is being processed.
        * access your personal data, including details about its origin, recipients, and purposes of processing.
        * request correction (rectification) of inaccurate data or deletion (erasure) of your data, subject to legal limitations.
        
        ### 2. Right to Restriction of Processing
        Under specific legal conditions, you may request a restriction on processing your personal data. This means your data can only be stored but not actively processed, unless your consent or processing is necessary for legal claims or other specified reasons.
        
        ### 3. Right to Data Portability
        If the processing of your data is based on your consent or a contractual necessity, you are entitled to
        * receive your data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, if technically feasible.
        * request the transfer of this data directly to another controller, where technically feasible.
        
        ### 4. Right to Object
        If your data is processed under Art. 6(1e) (public interest) or Art. 6(1f) (legitimate interest), you may object to its processing. Your objection must be based on reasons relating to your particular situation. Processing will cease unless compelling legitimate grounds are demonstrated.
        
        ### 5. Right to Withdraw Consent
        You have the right to revoke your consent to data processing at any time. Please note that revocation does not affect the lawfulness of data processing already carried out before your withdrawal.
        
        ### 6. Right to be Informed of Data Breaches
        If a data breach occurs that poses a high risk to your rights and freedoms, you have the right to be informed promptly, as required by GDPR.
        
        ### 7. Right to Lodge a Complaint
        For any inquiries regarding the processing of your personal data or to exercise these rights, please feel free to contact our data protection office (see above) at any time.
        
        If you believe your personal data is being processed unlawfully or in violation of GDPR, you can file a complaint with a supervisory authority. The authority responsible for us is:<br />

        Website: https://www.lfd.niedersachsen.de
        
        ## Data Transfer to Third Countries
        We do not transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) or to third countries that do not provide an adequate level of data protection as defined under the GDPR. Any data processing within the EU is carried out in compliance with the GDPR to ensure the security and privacy of your personal data. Should a transfer outside the EEA become necessary in the future, we will implement appropriate safeguards to ensure your data remains protected.
        
        ## Security Measures
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the protection of your personal data, including encryption and secure data storage practices. We also regularly review these measures to maintain their effectiveness.
        
        ## Collection of General Data and Information (Logfiles)
        
        Whenever a data subject calls the TIB web pages, these pages automatically collect information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to the TIB. This is:
        * Browser type and browser version
        * Operating system used
        * Referrer URL
        * Hostname of the accessing computer
        * IP address
        * Internet service provider of the accessing system
        * Time of the server request
        
        As a general rule, this data is not attributable to a particular person. This data will not be merged with other data sources. Collecting the information is a technical necessity to display the website and ensure its stability and security (legal basis is art. 6 par. 1 f EU GDPR).
        
        ## Changes to the Privacy Policy
        We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy as necessary, in accordance with the GDPR and future changes regarding our collection and processing of personal data. Any changes will be communicated on this page, and the updated date will be reflected at the end of the policy.
        
        The privacy was prepared in April 2025 and last reviewed on July 1, 2025.
