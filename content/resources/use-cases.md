      title: Use Cases
      text: |
        PID4NFI works with several different PID use cases from NFDI, in close collaboration with stakeholders from the respective consortia and services.
        
        Explore real-world examples of PID integrations across NFDI consortia and discover use cases that bridge diverse disciplines – from PID registration workflows in life sciences to metadata harmonization in social sciences – illustrating how PIDs enhance interoperability, reproducibility, and long-term accessibility. The examples reflect PID4NFDI's aim to standardize PID usage, enhance governance, and support interoperability across NFDI consortia.

      subtitle: <h3>Metadata Analysis</h3>
      text: |
        The purpose of this analysis is a comprehensive evaluation of the metadata quality and completeness for the StrainInfo service. [StrainInfo](https://straininfo.dsmz.de/), operated by the Leibniz Institute DSMZ – German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH, is an integral part of the [NFDI4Microbiota](https://nfdi4microbiota.de/) consortium. This analysis, conducted by DataCite, highlights the current state of metadata in StrainInfo, offering insights into its alignment with persistent identifier and metadata best practices.

      text: |
        The purpose of this analysis is a comprehensive evaluation of the metadata quality and completeness of the [Genebank Information System (GBIS)](https://gbis.ipk-gatersleben.de/) in the [FAIRagro](https://fairagro.net/) consortium. This analysis, conducted by DataCite, highlights the current state of metadata, offering insights into its alignment with persistent identifier and metadata best practices.

      title: <h2>PID Service for Dataset Elements (KonsortSWD)</h2>
      subtitle: <h3>Use Case Analysis</h3>
      text: |
        The purpose of this analysis is to showcase PID integration in a new PID service that is being developed within the [KonsortSWD](https://www.konsortswd.de/) consortium. This service aims to reference elements below the dataset, study, or publication level via PID, enhancing FAIRness of low-granular dataset elements and fulfilling requirements such as handling a large number of PIDs.

      title: <h2>PID Adoption at SUB Göttingen (Text+)</h2>
      subtitle: <h3>Use Case Analysis</h3>
      text: |
        The purpose of this analysis is to showcase PID integration within the [Text+](https://text-plus.org/) consortium using the example of the [SUB Göttingen](https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/). The report focuses on two well-integratied and long-running repositories ([DARIAH-DE](https://de.dariah.eu/) and [TextGrid](https://textgrid.de/)) for text-based research data from the humanities. We give details on different types of integrated PIDs, metadata quality handling, interaction with major infrastructures such as DARIAH and CLARIN, and describe new requirements and developments such as improved user input interfaces.
