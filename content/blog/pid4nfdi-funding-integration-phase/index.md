We are delighted to announce that PID4NFDI has been accepted for further funding until 2026.

<!--more-->

Following the NFDI's consortia assembly's decision on 11 October 2024, PID4NFDI received the [good news](https://www.nfdi.de/new-funding-approved-for-basic-services-rdmtraining4nfdi-pid4nfdi-and-ts4nfdi/?lang=en) that funding will continue for two years, 2025 and 2026. This means that our proposal [submitted in August of this year](https://base4nfdi.de/overview-submission-rounds) for a second two-year phase in [Base4NFDI's service candidates development and funding scheme](https://base4nfdi.de/process/decision-making) was successful. This second phase, called integration phase, will follow the currently running initialization phase and hence begin at the start of 2025 and continue into 2026. PID4NFDI is [currently one of eight Base4NFDI services in development](https://base4nfdi.de/projects), and coming 2025 will be one of three service candidates in integration phase.

PID4NFDI's current initialization phase focuses on use cases and requirements analyses, concept development, stakeholder identification, and setting up outreach channels. Examples of outcomes are our upcoming [stakeholder workshop](../../events/2024-pid4nfdistakeholderworkshop/), a NFDI-wide PID landscape analysis to be published later this year, and information and training resources, among them this website.

In the integration phase, PID4NFDI aims to enhance PID integration within NFDI consortia, considering varying provider maturity levels and community adoption. We will focus on integrating PIDs throughout the research data lifecycle, using Data Management Plans (DMPs) and Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) as pilot implementations. Special emphasis will be placed on the integration of PIDs for objects for which PID registration is still emerging, such as research instruments, material samples, highly granular data, as well as projects and awards. Our goal is to boost the impact of PIDs by improving metadata quality and interoperability through technical, organisational, and strategic measures. Furthermore, governance guidelines, outreach efforts, and a modular training concept will promote PID awareness and adoption across disciplines. This approach will be prototyped collaboratively with NFDI consortia partners, ensuring broad applicability within the NFDI framework. Interoperability, metadata, governance, training/support, and community engagement components, will together form a _PID Coordination Hub_, which will be a central entry point for users of the PID4NFDI service portfolio.
