        subtitle: How to get a PID and select a PID provider 
        text: | 
            The **PID4NFDI Cookbook** is a practical guide designed to help individuals and organizations get started with PID registration and usage. It provides support for understanding what PIDs are, why they are important for long-term access and citation of digital resources, and how to integrate them into your workflows. The guide includes:
            - An **introduction** to PIDs and their role in research data management.
            - Introductory guidance on **choosing the right PID system**, with tools like checklists and the PID Guide.
            - Practical insights into commonly used **PID types**, such as DOI, ORCID, ARK, IGSN, ROR, and Wikidata.
            
            As a work in progress, it will continue to grow and adapt to meet the needs of the (NFDI) research community.
