        subtitle: New to PIDs? Learn why persistent identifiers are important and how they make your research FAIR.
        text: |
            ## What are PIDs?
            A persistent identifier, or short PID, is a unique alphanumeric code that makes it possible to uniquely and sustainably reference objects, persons and organizations. Importantly, a PID is linked to descriptive information (metadata) about the resource, thereby providing context information. The use of PIDs is growing steadily and is being extended to more and more areas of research, for example through the development of PIDs for samples, data management plans or research projects.
            
            Hence, a growing variety of resource types/entities are covered by PIDs. Among them are: research data, instruments, cultural objects, data management plans, organisations, projects, persons, physical objects (samples), publication services and repositories, research information systems, research tools (such as electronic lab notebooks), scientific events, software, text publications. The use of PIDs is an essential component for the implementation of the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) that promote the findability, accessibility, interoperability and re-usability of research data. The mandatory and standardized metadata associated with PIDs make research data findable, accessible and citable.

            ## PID4NFDI Cookbook
            The **PID4NFDI Cookbook** is a practical guide designed to help individuals and organizations get started with PID registration and usage. It provides support for understanding what PIDs are, why they are important for long-term access and citation of digital resources, and how to integrate them into your workflows. The guide includes:
            - An **introduction** to PIDs and their role in research data management.
            - Introductory guidance on **choosing the right PID system**, with tools like checklists and the PID Guide.
            - Practical insights into commonly used **PID types**, such as DOI, ORCID, ARK, IGSN, ROR, and Wikidata.
            
            As a work in progress, it will continue to grow and adapt to meet the needs of the (NFDI) research community.
