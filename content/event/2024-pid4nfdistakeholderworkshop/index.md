Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are central to FAIR research data management. They allow broad interlinking of data, metadata and resources, and are thus crucial for research and open science. However, different disciplines and different resources result in diverse requirements, and the different NFDI consortia have different levels of maturity in PID implementation.

PID4NFDI, the basic service for persistent identifiers in NFDI, is holding this stakeholder workshop to identify further needs and challenges the stakeholders are confronted with in the implementation and usage of PIDs – and to discuss further steps required to improve PID implementation and the support services developed by PID4NFDI. We invite all representatives of NFDI consortia and sections, stakeholders from (inter)national initiatives and projects, and all other interested parties working on PID implementation to join us for this opportunity on November 11, 2024.

Registration will be available from September 9, 2024.
