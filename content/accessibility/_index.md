        * Some images may miss an alternative text (_alt_ attribute).
        * Some hyperlinked text in the footer may be too small and/or too closely spaced, going below a minimum touch target size for touch devices.
        * Some elements do not have sufficient color contrast ratio between the foreground text and its background, hence do not meet minimum contrast ratio threshold recommendations.
        * Some content may be non-accessible for screen readers and other assistive technology as the respective tests may have not been performed comprehensively for all scenarios.
