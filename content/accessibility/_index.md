      title: Accessibility Statement
      text: |
        The information on the accessibility of these web pages and its contact details are in accordance with § 9b NBGG.
        
        This accessibility statement applies to _pid.services.base4nfdi.de_ and its sub-pages.
        
        ## Compliance Status
        These websites are mostly compatible with the requirements of the harmonized European standard EN 301 549 V2.1.2 (08-2018) and WCAG 2.1 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). The non-compliances and/or exemptions are listed below.
        
        ## Non-Accessible Content
        * Some content is integrated into this website from a third-party source (for example, via frames) over which we do not have full authority and control. This content may be non-accessible or become non-accessible at any point in the future.
        * Some images may miss an alternative text (_alt_ attribute).
        * Some hyperlinked text in the footer may be too small and/or too closely spaced, going below a minimum touch target size for touch devices.
        * Some elements do not have sufficient color contrast ratio between the foreground text and its background, hence do not meet minimum contrast ratio threshold recommendations.
        * Some content may be non-accessible for screen readers and other assistive technology as the respective tests may have not been performed comprehensively for all scenarios.
        
        ## Preparation of this Accessibility Atatement
        The statement was prepared in March 2025 and last reviewed on March 27, 2025.
