        subtitle: What the PID Coordination Hub Can Do for You ‚Äì Now and in the Future
        text: |
            The questions and answers below reflect the types of support, services, and guidance the <a href="https://pid.services.base4nfdi.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PID Coordination Hub </a> **currently offers or aims to offer** during the integration phase (2025‚Äì2026)

            While some services are already in place, **many are still in development** and depend on community feedback, resource availability, and evolving priorities. We share this roadmap transparently to invite collaboration and manage expectations.
            
            These plans are **not fixed commitments**, but part of a living framework that evolves with your input.  They represent our aspirational vision for building a **robust, interoperable, and inclusive PID ecosystem** in support of NFDI consortia and the broader research community.
            
            üëâ Send us your most urgent questions, unmet needs, or use cases, they help us prioritize and refine the services we build next. We actively invite your engagement.

                    The PID Coordination Hub helps you identify and prioritize key PIDs relevant to repository management, including DOIs (e.g. datasets/publications), ePIC handles, (e.g. datasets, instruments), ORCID iDs (researchers), RORs (institutions), and IGSNs (samples). We offer tailored guidance to ensure your system supports the most impactful identifiers for your community.

                    We provide training and reference materials that directly link PID use to FAIR principles. By embedding PIDs at the point of deposit and aligning metadata with standards like DataCite, FDO kernel profile, bioschemas & schema.org, we help make your repository content more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

                    Absolutely. One of the core missions of the PID Coordination Hub is to reduce barriers to entry. We provide use-case examples, support the adoption of low-barrier services like B2INST for instrument PIDs, prefix registration support, and reusable templates for teams with limited capacity.
                    </details>

                    No. PID4NFDI will not act as a PID provider or registration agency. Instead, our role is to simplify and scale access to existing PID service providers, such as those offered by DataCite, ePIC, ORCID, and others, and to help the community get more value from the infrastructure already in place.<br>
                    The PID Coordination Hub focuses on:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Connecting you to the right PID services for your use case</li>
                      <li>Supporting test prefix access and early-stage integration</li>
                      <li>Coordinating best practices, metadata alignment, and policy development</li>
                      <li>Helping institutions and consortia benefit from existing PID ecosystems without duplicating them</li>
                    </ul>
                    We‚Äôre here to make PID adoption easier and more impactful, not to reinvent what already works.
                    </details>

                    <details>
                    <summary><span style="color:#2a6ebc;">Can we get PIDs for free through PID4NFDI?<span style="background:#e6f4ea; color:#1a7f37; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px; font-weight:bold;">üü¢ Available now</span></span></summary><br>
                    
                    <b>Not exactly</b>. While PID4NFDI is working to lower barriers to PID adoption, for example through free test prefixes during integration phases or by offering low-barrier services like B2INST, the registration and long-term maintenance of production-grade PIDs incur real costs.<br>
                    PID infrastructure requires sustainable funding for system development, service availability, metadata preservation, and governance. Providers like DataCite, ePIC, and others operate on cost-recovery models. However, multiple cost-benefit analyses have shown that using PIDs reduces long-term administrative and technical costs by improving metadata quality, interoperability, and reuse.<br>
                    The PID Coordination Hub supports institutions by:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Helping identify the most cost-effective PID service options</li>
                      <li>Providing planning templates for sustainable PID service integration</li>
                      <li>Facilitating free test environments and pilot-level ePIC handle registration to support technical integration and evaluation</li>
                      <li>Facilitating negotiations with PID providers (e.g. ePIC contracts) to ensure sustainability beyond the project phase</li>
                    </ul>
                    We also help institutions explore shared service models, consortial memberships, and integration strategies that maximize value while minimizing direct costs.<br>

                    <br>
                    The Coordination Hub will provide crosswalks to align your schema with DataCite Metadata Schema 4.6, schema.org, and Bioschemas. We also offer access to controlled vocabularies and mappings to ensure clean, consistent PID usage across your records.

                    <br>
                    We provide assessment checklists and reporting dashboards to evaluate metadata completeness and FAIR compliance. Additionally, the Metadata Consultation Framework and training modules offer support for improving metadata quality at the field level.<br>

                    <br>
                    Yes. We provide discipline-agnostic best practices for defining metadata at appropriate granularity (e.g., dataset subsets, instrument-level descriptions). This helps you represent research more accurately while staying interoperable.

                    Persistent Identifiers can help make it easier to connect research outputs, contributors, and affiliations across systems. When used consistently, they may support more streamlined and reliable reporting processes. The PID Coordination Hub can advise on how to incorporate PIDs into your existing infrastructure in ways that could enhance transparency and interoperability, depending on your specific context and needs.

                    Yes. We offer examples that demonstrate how PIDs appear in lab notebooks, DMP tools, and repositories, and how metadata flows between them. These are excellent for showcasing lifecycle integration. We also run focus groups to learn from ongoing implementations, exchange lessons learned, and surface real-world challenges. You‚Äôre welcome to join these conversations via our <a href="https://pid.services.base4nfdi.de/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> events page </a>, a dedicated focus group <a href="https://pid.services.base4nfdi.de/community/focus-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> subpage </a> will be available soon.

                   PIDs make research Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Hub supports the integration of PIDs into your workflows and systems, enabling your institution to demonstrate leadership in FAIR data and align with open science mandates from funders and national strategies. PID adoption also improves reporting and visibility, while helping to save resources by reducing duplication, streamlining workflows, and lowering long-term data management costs.

                   We provide slide decks, speaking points, and policy briefs that explain how PID adoption supports:
                   <ul>
                     <li>Research integrity and attribution</li>
                     <li>Efficiency in reporting and metadata management</li>
                     <li>Resource savings through automation, reduced duplication, and improved data quality</li>
                     <li>Open Science leadership</li>
                     <li>Reporting efficiency and compliance</li>
                     <li>More accurate tracking of institutional research impact, including reuse and collaboration networks</li>
                     <li>Global visibility and benchmarking</li>
                   </ul>
                   These are ideal for internal pitches, strategy meetings, and external evaluations.
