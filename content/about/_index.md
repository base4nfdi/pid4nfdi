        subtitle: Persistent Identifier Services for the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)
        text: |
            PID4NFDI is a basic service for persistent identifiers in development for the German National Research Data Infrastructure ([Nationale Forschungsdaten&shy;infrastruktur – NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en)). PID4NFDI is part of [Base4NFDI](https://base4nfdi.de/) and is currently in its integration phase, the second of three [service development phases](https://base4nfdi.de/process).
            
            Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are central to FAIR research data management. However, different disciplines and different resources result in diverse requirements and the different NFDI consortia have different levels of maturity in PID implementation. PID4NFDI will design a work programme to build an NFDI foundation service on established PID infrastructures.
            
            As there already is a mature and globally used PID provider landscape and PID needs are highly individual in the consortia, we define our intended service as a set of several components (technical, organisational, standards, training, outreach) that are in their interaction tailored to the needs of NFDI stakeholders.

        title: Goals, Projects and Services of PID4NFDI
        text: |
            PID4NFDI aims to enhance PID integration within NFDI consortia, considering varying provider maturity levels and community adaptation. Our goal is to boost PID impact by improving metadata quality and interoperability through technical, organisational, and strategic measures. Governance guidelines, outreach efforts, and a modular training concept will promote PID awareness and adoption across disciplines, prototyped collaboratively with consortia partners to ensure broad applicability within NFDI. The interoperability, metadata, governance, training/support, and community engagement components will together form the PID Coordination Hub, which will be a central entry point for users of the PID4NFDI service portfolio.
            
            * To enable repository managers to optimize the integration of PIDs into their workflows,
            * To support trainers in the FDM field with materials and information,
            * To demonstrate to researchers, decision-makers, and funders the added value of PIDs for their own workflows and processes,
            * To provide best practices for different use cases to NFDI multipliers like sections and working groups.
            
            PID4NFDI is organized internally by different work packages that cover these measures and areas of engagement. We operate as part of [Base4NFDI](https://base4nfdi.de/), a joint initiative of all 26 consortia within NFDI to foster and establish reliable NFDI-wide basic services, and are one of [several basic services in development](https://base4nfdi.de/projects)
            
            The organizations responsible for operating PID4NFDI are [DataCite](https://datacite.org/), the [Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH Göttingen (GWDG)](https://gwdg.de), the [Helmholtz Open Science Office](https://os.helmholtz.de/) and the [TIB – German National Library of Science and Technology](https://www.tib.eu/).

        title: Stakeholders
        text: |
            ## Stakeholders Within NFDI
            
            Within NFDI, the primary stakeholders for PID4NFDI are the 26 domain-specific [NFDI consortia](https://www.nfdi.de/consortia/), with all their different members of various roles, backgrounds and from various types of organizations. Important individuals from the consortia are the ones working with PID implementation, either technically or on infrastructure or governance level, e.g. repository managers or information officers. The current five [NFDI sections](https://www.nfdi.de/sections/), including their working groups, address cross-cutting topics relevant to multiple or all consortia. PID4NFDI was initiated out of the section _Common Infrastructures_. PID4NFDI is part of [Base4NFDI](https://base4nfdi.de/), which is an important stakeholder – as are the [other basic services currently in development](https://base4nfdi.de/projects).
            
            ## Stakeholders Beyond NFDI
            
            Beyond NFDI, PID service providers are crucial stakeholders because they manage and maintain the infrastructure for assigning and resolving PIDs, establish standards and best practices for PID usage, thereby contributing to interoperability and consistency across different systems. Important for PID4NFDI are the services of the two project partners [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) and [GWDG](https://gwdg.de/) (with [ePIC](https://www.pidconsortium.net/), the European Persistent Identifier Consortium), as well as further service providers such as the [ARK Alliance](https://arks.org/), [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), and [ROR](https://ror.org/) (Research Organization Registry), among others. The [European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-and-innovation/our-digital-future/open-science/european-open-science-cloud-eosc_en) is important to recognize as a stakeholder itself and as an environment of and for stakeholders. This is especially relevant as [NFDI is part of EOSC’s build-up phase](https://www.nfdi.de/nfdi-is-part-of-eoscs-build-up-phase/) and in light of [EOSC’s PID policy](https://doi.org/10.2777/926037).
            
            For a more extensive overview of the stakeholders and other projects and initiatives relevant for PID4NFDI, refer to our [communication strategy](/publication/2024-pid4nfdi-b/).
            
            ## Collaboration with PID Network Germany
            
            PID4NFDI closely collaborates with the project [PID Network Germany](https://www.pid-network.de/), which aims to establish a network in science and culture that promotes and consolidates the application, implementation, standardization and international connectivity of PID systems on a national and international level. Both projects have an overlap in partners (DataCite, Helmholtz Open Science Office and TIB – German National Library of Science and Technology) and are hence aligned through bilateral coordination and a well-established exchange of information, which is important due to the different scopes of the projects: PID4NFDI focuses on PID implementation in the context of NFDI and especially within NFDI consortia with analyses of specific use cases. PID Network Germany addresses the wider scientific and cultural sector, covering a more extensive range of PID application areas beyond research data (management) and with a focus on a wide variety of use cases and stakeholders. PID4NFDI can use and integrate results and findings from PID Network Germany, and vice versa: For example, PID4NFDI will adapt the national PID roadmap to be released by PID Network Germany in developing PID guidelines for NFDI, while in turn PID4NFDI contributes PID-related NFDI activities and perspectives to PID Network Germany.
