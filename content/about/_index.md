      text: |
       
        PID4NFDI is a basic service for persistent identifiers in development for the German National Research Data Infrastructure ([Nationale Forschungsdaten&shy;infrastruktur – NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en)). PID4NFDI is part of [Base4NFDI](https://base4nfdi.de/) and is currently in its integration phase, the second of three [service development phases](https://base4nfdi.de/process).
        
        Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are central to FAIR research data management. However, different disciplines and different resources result in diverse requirements and the different NFDI consortia have different levels of maturity in PID implementation. PID4NFDI will design a work programme to build an NFDI foundation service on established PID infrastructures.
        
        As there already is a mature and globally used PID provider landscape and PID needs are highly individual in the consortia, we define our intended service as a set of several components (technical, organisational, standards, training, outreach) that are in their interaction tailored to the needs of NFDI stakeholders.

              PID4NFDI aims to enhance PID integration within NFDI consortia, considering varying provider maturity levels and community adaptation. Our goal is to boost PID impact by improving metadata quality and interoperability through technical, organisational, and strategic measures. Governance guidelines, outreach efforts, and a modular training concept will promote PID awareness and adoption across disciplines, prototyped collaboratively with consortia partners to ensure broad applicability within NFDI. The interoperability, metadata, governance, training/support, and community engagement components will together form the PID Coordination Hub, which will be a central entry point for users of the PID4NFDI service portfolio.

      title: Collaboration with PID Network Germany
      text: |
        PID4NFDI closely collaborates with the project [PID Network Germany](https://www.pid-network.de/), which aims to establish a network in science and culture that promotes and consolidates the application, implementation, standardization and international connectivity of PID systems on a national and international level. Both projects have an overlap in partners (DataCite, Helmholtz Open Science Office and TIB – German National Library of Science and Technology) and are hence aligned through bilateral coordination and a well-established exchange of information, which is important due to the different scopes of the projects: PID4NFDI focuses on PID implementation in the context of NFDI and especially within NFDI consortia with analyses of specific use cases. PID Network Germany addresses the wider scientific and cultural sector, covering a more extensive range of PID application areas beyond research data (management) and with a focus on a wide variety of use cases and stakeholders. PID4NFDI can use and integrate results and findings from PID Network Germany, and vice versa: For example, PID4NFDI will adapt the national PID roadmap to be released by PID Network Germany in developing PID guidelines for NFDI, while in turn PID4NFDI contributes PID-related NFDI activities and perspectives to PID Network Germany.
