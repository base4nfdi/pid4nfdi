      title: What is PID4NFDI?
      subtitle: Persistent Identifier Services for the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)
      text: |
        PID4NFDI is a basic service for persistent identifiers in development for the German National Research Data Infrastructure ([Nationale Forschungsdaten&shy;infrastruktur â€“ NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en)). PID4NFDI is part of [Base4NFDI](https://base4nfdi.de/) and is currently in its initialisation phase, the first of three service development phases.

        Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are central to FAIR research data management. However, different disciplines and different resources result in diverse requirements and the different NFDI consortia have different levels of maturity in PID implementation. PID4NFDI will design a work programme to build an NFDI foundation service on established PID infrastructures.

      title: What are PIDs?
      text: |
        A persistent identifier, or short PID, is a unique alphanumeric code that makes it possible to uniquely and sustainably reference objects, persons and organizations. Importantly, a PID is linked to descriptive information (metadata) about the resource, thereby providing context information. The use of PIDs is growing steadily and is being extended to more and more areas of research, for example through the development of PIDs for samples, data management plans or research projects.

        Hence, a growing variety of resource types/entities are covered by PIDs. Among them are: research data, instruments, cultural objects, data management plans, organisations, projects, persons, physical objects (samples), publication services and repositories, research information systems, research tools (such as electronic lab notebooks), scientific events, software, text publications.
        
        The use of PIDs is an essential component for the implementation of the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) that promote the findability, accessibility, interoperability and re-usability of research data. The mandatory and standardized metadata associated with PIDs make research data findable, accessible and citable.

        You can learn more about PIDs, their use cases and technical implementation at our partners [PID Network Germany](https://www.pid-network.de/en/) and the [PID Competence Center of TIB](https://projects.tib.eu/pid-service/en/persistent-identifiers/persistent-identifiers-pids/).

      title: What are the goals, projects and services of PID4NFDI?
      text: |
        PID4NFDI aims to enhance PID integration within NFDI consortia, considering varying provider maturity levels and community adaption. Our goal is to boost PID impact by improving metadata quality and interoperability through technical, organisational, and strategic measures. Governance guidelines, outreach efforts, and a modular training concept will promote PID awareness and adoption across disciplines, prototyped collaboratively with consortia partners to ensure broad applicability within NFDI. The interoperability, metadata, governance, training/support and community engagement components will together form the PID Coordination Hub, which will be a central entry point for users of the PID4NFDI service portfolio.

        PID4NFDI is organized internally by different work packages that cover these measures and areas of engagement. We operate as part of [Base4NFDI](https://base4nfdi.de/), a joint initiative of all 26 consortia within NFDI to foster and establish reliable NFDI-wide basic services, and are one of [several basic services in development](https://base4nfdi.de/projects).
