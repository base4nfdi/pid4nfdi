The PID4NFDI team invites you to participate in a collaborative initiative focused on the **integration of Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) within DMPs** and providing PID-related support.

We are establishing a **dedicated focus group on this topic** to collectively address important focus areas, including but not limited to: metadata quality and completeness; PID registration and integration into existing platforms; lifecycle integration challenges associated with PIDs; evaluation of existing and development of new training resources and best practice documentation; policy alignment, including meeting funder requirements.

We **invite you and everyone interested from NFDI to participate in and contribute to the focus group**, especially if you regularly work with DMPs and their integration in technical systems and infrastructure and/or issues of metadata in DMPs. Different backgrounds, perspectives and levels of expertise will be crucial and are very much welcome.

The **initial meeting** of the focus group will be held on **April 1, 2025, 1:00 to 2:30 pm**. (No april's fools.)
In the meeting, PID4NFDI will introduce our two-year plan in the Base4NFDI integration phase, and together we will define collaborative tasks and establish a clear action plan.

If you are interested in participating or should you have any questions or require further information, please contact me or write us an email at pid4nfdi@lists.nfdi.de.
