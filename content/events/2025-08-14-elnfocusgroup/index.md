The last meeting of the focus group took place on August 14, 2025. In the meeting, Frederik Springer, project member from the TIB, shared an overview on the research tool for PIDs for instruments (PIDInst), which he developed in the course of the project, to facilitate the discovery of instrument PIDs and related metadata.  

Frederik's slides and the meeting notes can be found here:
