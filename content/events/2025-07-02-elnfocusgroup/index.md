PID4NFDI warmly invites you to join our focus groups on the integration of Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) within Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs). More general information on the focus roups can be found on the dedicated subpage [*Focus Groups*](https://pid.services.base4nfdi.de/community/focus-groups/).

The second meeting of the focus group took place on July 2, 2025.
In the meeting, Sara El-Gebali, Metadata Specialist at DataCite, gave a presentation on the background to the implementation of PIDs in ELNs. The participants were then invited to engage in an open discussion and a question-and-answer session. The following questions were posed during this session:
  *How does PID metadata (e.g., DOIs, ORCIDs, IGSNs) flow into or out of your tool? Please describe your current or desired data lineage for PID metadata.
  *How would you characterize an entry in your system? Would you call it an ELN entry, a collection, a project, a report, or something else?
