Digital research tools like Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) and Data Management Planning (DMP) systems are critical for early-stage metadata capture and documenting research processes. These tools increasingly support Persistent Identifier (PID) workflows, either by referencing existing identifiers or enabling PID registration for core research entities like datasets, samples, instruments, methods, and projects.

Capturing rich metadata at the earliest stages of research can:

* Enhance metadata quality at the point of creation.
* Minimize metadata loss in downstream systems.
* Facilitate PID registration, linkage, and reusability.

The workshop was hosted by PID4NFDI. The project supports the development of sustainable PID infrastructures and integration strategies across the NFDI landscape, ensuring metadata from ELNs and DMPs aligns with PID requirements to achieve higher metadata quality and enable automated, interoperable workflows.

This workshop gathered ELN and DMP tool developers, metadata specialists, and stakeholders from NFDI consortia to:  

* Validate and Extend the Metadata Framework
  * Review the metadata your tools currently capture for key research entities (e.g., samples, datasets, instruments).

* Enable Seamless PID Workflows
  * Explore practical use cases for integrating PIDs (e.g., ePICs, DOIs, IGSNs) directly into your workflows.

* Define and Measure Metadata Completeness
  * Establish a shared understanding of what constitutes “good enough” metadata for your infrastructure.
  * Develop quality indicators, completeness thresholds, and scoring or validation mechanisms to guide users.

* Explore Interoperability Solutions
  * Discover how TS4NFDI tools can connect your solutions with others to enable smooth cross-system data flows.
  * Identify opportunities to develop and test your use cases as incubator projects supported by both PID4NFDI and TS4NFDI.

Target group were developers and technical architects of ELN and DMP tools. Metadata and interoperability experts from NFDI consortia, and representatives from incubator projects focusing on ELN/DMP integration.

## Organizational Aspects
The conference was conducted in English. 

Registration for on-site participation was limited to 20 people. Lighting talk sessions on Day 1 and 2 of the workshop were streamed online via Zoom.  

The speaker's slides are published in our [PID4NFDI Zenodo Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/pid4nfdi).
