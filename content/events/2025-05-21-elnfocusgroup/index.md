We would like to set up a **dedicated focus group** on this topic to collectively address important focus areas, including but not limited to: metadata quality and completeness; PID registration and integration into existing platforms; lifecycle integration challenges associated with PIDs; evaluation of existing and development of new training resources and best practice documentation; policy alignment, including meeting funder requirements.
We invite **everyone interested from NFDI** to participate in and contribute to the focus group, especially if you regularly work with ELNs and their integration in technical systems and infrastructure and/or issues of metadata in ELNs. Different backgrounds, perspectives and levels of expertise will be crucial and are very much welcome.

The initial meeting of the focus group will be held on **May 21, 2025, 1:00 to 2:30 pm**.
In the meeting, PID4NFDI will introduce our two-year plan in the Base4NFDI integration phase, and together we will define collaborative tasks and establish a clear action plan.

✉️ If you are interested in participating, please **register** via the following link:

We really look forward to your participation and valuable contributions. If you have any questions or require further information, please feel free to contact us via pid4nfdi@lists.nfdi.de.
