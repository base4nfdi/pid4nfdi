Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are central to FAIR research data management making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. They allow broad interlinking of data, metadata and resources, and are thus crucial for research and open science. However, different disciplines and resources reflect the complexity of implementing PIDs across various research fields.

PID4NFDI is the basic service for persistent identifiers (PIDs) in development for the German National Research Data Infrastructure (Nationale Forschungsdaten­infrastruktur – NFDI). Efforts are currently underway to build a basic service based on established PID infrastructures to provide various PID-related services to NFDI stakeholders. The different stages of implementation of PIDs by the various NFDI consortia illustrate the ongoing progress and obstacles encountered by the basic service PID4NFDI. 

Therefore, PID4NFDI is organizing a stakeholder workshop with the objective of gathering insights from participants regarding their experiences with PID implementation and usage. This workshop will serve as a platform for representatives from NFDI consortia, international initiatives, projects, and other interested parties to share their perspectives on current practices and explore potential improvements in PID services.

We invite all stakeholders from international and national initiatives and projects, especially representatives of NFDI consortia and sections, to join us on November 11, 2024, for this collaborative opportunity to discuss strategies for enhancing PID implementation and the support services offered by PID4NFDI.
