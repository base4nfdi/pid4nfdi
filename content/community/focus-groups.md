      title: PID4NFDI Focus groups

      text: |
        PID4NFDI warmly invites you to join our focus groups on the integration of Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) within **Data Management Plans** (DMPs) and **Electronic Lab Notebooks** (ELNs).
        These focus groups are designed to collaboratively explore key topics, including but not limited to:
        
        * PID registration and integration into existing platforms
        * Metadata quality and completeness
        * Lifecycle integration challenges associated with PIDs
        * Evaluation of current training resources and development of new best practice documentation
        * Policy alignment, including compliance with funder requirements
        
        We welcome participation **from anyone** interested, **both within NFDI and beyond**. If you regularly work with DMPs and/or ELNs, their integration into technical systems and infrastructures, or issues related to metadata management, your insights will be highly valuable. We encourage participants to come from a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and levels of expertise, as this diversity is essential for a fruitful discussion.
        
        The focus groups meet online on a regular basis. Upcoming meetings will be announced via Rocket.Chat (NFDI All-chat) and the [Events](https://pid.services.base4nfdi.de/events/) section of our website, where you can also find notes from previous meetings.
        
        Additionally, you are welcome to present your **use case** related to PID usage within DMPs or ELNs during the meeting. To do so, please contact Antonia at antonia.schrader@os.helmholtz.de in advance to schedule your presentation.
