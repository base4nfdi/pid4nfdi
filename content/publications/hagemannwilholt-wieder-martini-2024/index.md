abstract: 'The PID4NFDI basic service project was presented as part of the NFDITalks: Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are central to FAIR research data management.Â However, different disciplines and different resources result in diverse requirements and the different NFDI consortia have different levels of maturity in PID implementation. PID4NFDI will design a work programme to build an NFDI foundation service on established PID infrastructures.'
