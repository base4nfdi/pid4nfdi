# Abstract
abstract: 'Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) and their accompanying metadata play a crucial role in effective research data management and the realization of FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The PID4NFDI coordination hub is dedicated to creating a sustainable, scalable, and community-driven framework for metadata interoperability across the NFDI landscape. This initiative seeks to harmonize metadata practices, enhance metadata quality and completeness, and ultimately improve the discoverability of research outputs.

In this talk, we will share actionable insights derived from recent metadata assessments using metrics from DataCiteâ€™s DOI metadata records, complemented by key findings from our survey on metadata practices within the NFDI community. These insights highlight critical factors influencing metadata quality and researcher engagement. Drawing from real-world examples, we demonstrate how comprehensive metadata, including bibliographic information and provenance details, supports the discoverability, reusability, and longterm sustainability of research outputs. Additionally, we outline upcoming initiatives within PID4NFDI to address identified metadata needs, emphasizing the critical role of PID service providers in improving metadata management practices. By highlighting strengths and pinpointing gaps in current metadata practices among NFDI consortia, we offer targeted recommendations that inform strategic decision-making and enhance organizational metadata workflows.Our collaborative approach aims to reduce administrative burdens, raise awareness among researchers and infrastructure providers about the importance of highquality metadata, and foster a unified metadata ecosystem, ultimately enhancing the value and impact of research data.'
