 abstract = {This report is part of the deliverables produced by PID4NFDI, a core service for persistent identifiers developed within the German National Research Data Infrastructure (Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur – NFDI). The initiative is funded through Base4NFDI, with financial support provided by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under grant number 521466146. Specifically, this report addresses the use-case analysis outlined in work packages 1 and 2 of the PID4NFDI initialization phase. The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the metadata quality and completeness for the StrainInfo service. StrainInfo, operated by the Leibniz Institute DSMZ – German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH, is an integral part of the NFDI4Microbiota consortium. This analysis, conducted by DataCite, highlights the current state of metadata in StrainInfo, offering insights into its alignment with persistent identifier and metadata best practices.},
