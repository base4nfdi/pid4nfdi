# Abstract
abstract: 'Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are central to FAIR research data management and have become an essential component of applications and services. However, the demand for PIDs for different resources results in diverse requirements: Different disciplines and NFDI consortia have different levels of maturity in PID implementation. Also, PID-related metadata are central to the FAIRness of research resources and support their reusability and the reproducibility of research. Initial analysis of the use cases, requirements and plans of the NFDI consortia has revealed that these and other challenges need to be addressed by the NFDI as a whole. PID4NFDI will address these challenges and design the work programme to build an NFDI foundation service on established PID infrastructures. Core players of the national and international PID service provider and developer community make up the PID4NFDI consortium. Within the initialisation phase it is planned to lay the foundation for further phases through use cases analyses, requirements engineering, and concept development. Envisaged results can be used as is, but will seamlessly lead to future development and integration activities. Regarding technical service implementation, PID4NFDI will follow a clear path of promoting the uptake by PID infrastructures and service providers and will only develop and operate NFDI-specific services if necessary.'
