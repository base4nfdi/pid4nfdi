# Abstract
abstract: 'Task 3.1 of PID4NFDI focuses on enhancing access to PID-referenced research objects, particularly research instruments, by developing a federated search tool that harmonizes instrument metadata queried from ePIC (B2INST) and DataCite APIs, and visualizes the connections between these instrument records and related scientific outputs for eventual integration into PID-based knowledge graphs.'
