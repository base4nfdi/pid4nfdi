 abstract = {The PID4NFDI project outlines a modular, multi-level training approach to promote the effective use of Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) across the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI). The approach is structured into three levels – Fundamental, Advanced, and Expert – catering to a wide range of users, including researchers, infrastructure managers, data curators, and developers. Each level progressively builds knowledge, from foundational PID concepts and FAIR data management to advanced integration strategies. Key features of the program include customizable learning paths tailored to specific academic cultures and research methods, with materials designed for various learning preferences. Formats such as videos, webinars, interactive workshops, and group discussions ensure accessibility and engagement. Evaluation and feedback loops are integrated to ensure continuous improvement of the training materials, which will be made openly available.},
