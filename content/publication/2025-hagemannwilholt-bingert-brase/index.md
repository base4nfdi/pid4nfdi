# Abstract
abstract: 'The following concept is an update of the concept published in 2022 by the PID (Persistent Identifier) Services working group within the NFDI Section "Common Infrastructures". The working group consists of representatives of existing PID services and as well as representatives from infrastructures using PIDs and who are already involved in various domain-specific consortia. The aim of the working group is to support the development of a PID service for the NFDI. The group is intended to serve as a forum to ensure the exchange between the emerging PID Coordination Hub, which is being developed by the PID4NFDI basic service project, and the NFDI consortia. Members of the working group can provide valuable input for service development, communicate needs from the consortia, and highlight best practices already in use for PID management. Resulting solutions should enable FAIR research workflows balancing out generic metadata requirements for PIDs that maximise resource discoverability on the one hand and subject-specific needs on the other. At the technical level, the partners want to realise interoperability between PID types and established systems and build on a high level of maturity here.'
