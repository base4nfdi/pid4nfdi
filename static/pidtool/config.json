      "text": "I want a PID with a strong, long-term commitment to persistence by the PID provider. ",
      "help": "Persistence is the core promise of a PID - but it’s not guaranteed by the technology alone. It depends on long-term organizational and financial commitment. Systems like DataCite DOIs, ePIC handles, and URN:NBN are backed by stable institutions/organizations that explicitly commit to maintaining resolvability over time. Handles and ARKs can also support persistence, but this varies with the implementation. Wikidata IDs are maintained by a large community under the Wikimedia Foundation, offering stability through collective stewardship."

      "text": "I want to work with a PID provider with transparent information on governance, fees and membership models.",
      "help": "Transparency about how a PID provider is governed, financed, and structured helps build trust and supports long-term planning. Institutions need to understand what they are committing to - including contracts, costs, and membership models. It’s also helpful to know what is planned for the coming years: Does the provider publish a roadmap? Are future developments openly communicated? Providers like DataCite and Wikidata typically offer insight into governance structures, pricing, and future directions. For systems like ePIC, ARK, or Handle, transparency varies depending on the specific service provider and may require direct inquiries to clarify contractual or financial terms.",

      "text": "I need a PID provider that offers cost-effective options for registering large numbers of PIDs.",
      "help": "When registering many PIDs - for example, for datasets, samples, or archival materials - costs can quickly accumulate. Some PID providers, such as ePIC or Wikidata, offer consortium-based or free models that support large-scale usage. Others, like DataCite DOIs, have tiered pricing or institutional membership models. Choosing a cost-effective provider is especially important when you plan to register many PIDs over time."

      "section": "Governance and Integration Strategy",
      "text": "I need additional services offered by the PID provider (on top of simple registration).",
      "help": "Some PID providers go beyond basic registration by offering added-value services such as metadata search portals, visual dashboards, citation tracking, metadata enrichment, or integration support. These services can enhance the usability, visibility, and impact of registered resources. DataCite, for example, provides usage stats, citation tracking, and GraphQL APIs. Wikidata supports rich semantic linking, and some ARK providers offer templates or UI tools. If these extras are important to your workflow or reporting needs, choosing a provider with a strong service portfolio can make a significant difference."

      "text": "I want to have the possibility to delete my PID.",
      "help": "While many PID systems are designed for long-term reference and persistence, some use cases - especially during early research phases or for internal workflows - may require the option to delete or deactivate PIDs. ARKs support flexible lifecycles, including deletion. Wikidata IDs can also be removed under certain conditions. In contrast, DataCite DOIs, ePIC handles, and URN:NBNs are designed to be permanent and generally do not support deletion once a PID is registered. Whether deletion is allowed depends on the provider’s policies and the intended role of the PID."

      "text": "I want to have the possibility to test the PID service before committing to a PID provider.",
      "help": "Before adopting a PID system, it can be valuable to test how it fits into your workflows - technically, administratively, or in terms of support. Some providers offer sandbox environments, trial accounts, or test prefixes that allow you to register and resolve test PIDs without long-term commitments. For example, DataCite and ePIC offer test environments upon request. ARKs and Handles can often be tested via local installations or demo servers. Wikidata, by contrast, allows immediate PID creation in its live environment - but without a separate test space. For URN:NBN, testing may require prior agreements and coordination with national libraries, and self-service options are typically not available."

      "text": "I want a PID provider that provides extensive training material and support.",
      "help": "Training resources and user support can make a big difference, especially during onboarding or when integrating PIDs into institutional workflows. DataCite offers extensive documentation, webinars, community calls, and helpdesk support. Wikidata has rich community-driven guides and discussion forums. ARKs and Handles are supported through technical documentation and user communities, but formal training is often limited. ePIC provides some documentation, but the depth and accessibility vary by national partner. URN:NBN systems usually depend on national libraries, where training and support may be limited or targeted to specific institutional partners."

      "section": "Metadata & Interoperability",
      "text": "I want a PID that comes with open metadata for re-use.",
      "help": "Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) are most valuable when the metadata describing the identified object is openly accessible, machine-readable, and available for reuse - e.g., through registries, catalogs, or aggregation services. This openness improves visibility, enables automated linking, supports citation tracking, and fosters interoperability. Many PID infrastructures - such as those supporting DOIs, ePIC Handles, ARKs, IGSNs, and Wikidata IDs - encourage or provide mechanisms for open metadata. In some cases, metadata is explicitly released under a public domain dedication like CC0 to remove legal barriers to reuse. However, licensing practices vary between PID providers and communities, so it’s important to check the specific metadata policies of the system in use."

      "section": "Metadata & Interoperability",
      "text": "Do you prefer a PID provider that comes with a standardised metadata schema, or a PID system that allows flexible configuration of metadata?",
      "help": "Many PID providers (e.g., DataCite DOIs, URN:NBN, …) define a metadata schema that needs to be adopted when working with the PID Provider. A standardized metadata schema fixes a limited number of pre-defined fields that are to be filled in by the user when registering a PID. Standardized metadata schemas enable interoperability between systems and metadata harvesting. It is often possible to extend a standardized metadata schema with domain specific fields as part of the repository metadata. Other PID Providers (e.g., ePIC, ARK, …) do not fix the metadata schema in advance. The service administrator can define the metadata schema that defines the fields for the end user according to his needs. Flexibility supports adjusting to use case specific needs of different domains or workflows."

      "help": "Machine-readablility means that metadata is structured in a way that computers can automatically process and understand them (for example, if metadata are expressed as JSON, XML, …). Machine-readable metadata enables machines to perform tasks such as data discovery, automation, and indexing. In contrast, human-readable metadata are designed for people to easily understand and interpret metadata. Machine readable metadata and human readable metadata are complementary (rather than mutually exclusive), as many PID providers provide both."

Landing pages are often provided by the repository which contains the research entity and serves as the entry point for humans to receive information (metadata) about the resource, such as citation infos, descriptions, and the link to the resource itself.

      "help": "Machine actionability refers to information or digital objects being structured and defined in a way that enables computers to automatically read, interpret, and take actions based on that information, with minimal or no human intervention. In practical terms, this means: The data is not just readable by machines (like text in a CSV), but also described with metadata that a machine understands what the data is and how it should be processed. If you require your data to be machine actionable, you should consider to publish them as FAIR digital objects (FDOs). FDOs specify their types and possible operations in a standardized way, so machines can not only read what an object is, but also what can be done with it (e.g., which APIs or transformations are valid)."

      "text": "I want to have a PID that points directly to a research entity (not to a landing page)",
      "help": "Different PIDs by default may resolve to different kinds of resources. Some PIDs resolve to landing pages with human readable metadata, others resolve to a set of machine readable metadata or directly to the research entity (e.g., a file). Some PID systems (such as DOI, URN:NBN) require that the PID resolves to a landing page which must contain human-readable metadata. URN:NBNs point to a landing page where you can publish or edit the metadata for an object. Other PID types (e.g. ePIC PID) are allowed to resolve to whatever URL the user requires. Resolving directly to an object may be reasonable if, for example, many (high-granular) data are generated during the research process which might not be published in the end, but still receive a PID that points to the raw data."
