      "help": "Persistence is the core promise of a PID - but itâ€™s not guaranteed by the technology alone. It depends on long-term organizational and financial commitment. Systems like <strong>DataCite DOIs</strong>, <strong>ePIC handles</strong>, and <strong>URN:NBN</strong> are backed by stable institutions/organizations that explicitly commit to maintaining resolvability over time. <strong>Handles</strong> and <strong>ARKs</strong> can also support persistence, but this varies with the implementation. <strong>Wikidata IDs</strong> are maintained by a large community under the Wikimedia Foundation, offering stability through collective stewardship."
